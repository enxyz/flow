# Flow

Flow by LabGrid is an open-source configurable workflow manager with a React/Typescript frontend, Python Flask backend, and Postgres database.  

This project is currently under active development. See the getting started documentation to run the app using Docker and Auth0 for user auth. Hosted version coming soon.

## Philosophy

We want to make a self-hosted workflow manager for companies and biotech labs that have privacy and security concerns about their data going to third party services. We are striving for an easy-to-deploy solution that can be used in regulated lab environments. Flow by LabGrid gives you full control over your lab's workflows and data.
