# Flow by LabGrid

Flow by LabGrid is an open-source configurable workflow manager with a React/Typescript frontend, Python Flask backend, and Postgres database.  

This project is currently under active development. See the getting started documentation to run the app using Docker and Auth0 for user auth. Hosted version coming soon.

## Philosophy

We want to make a self-hosted workflow manager for companies and biotech labs that have privacy and security concerns about their data going to third party services. We are striving for an easy-to-deploy solution that can be used in regulated lab environments. Flow by LabGrid gives you full control over your lab's workflows and data. 

## Features
- **Custom workflow manager** - a customizable workflow manager you can deploy in your own environment 
- **Drag and drop protocol widgets** - easy to make new workflow widgets
- **Audit trails and reporting** - reports available for all events
- **React Native support** - (work in progress)
- **For your whole team** - share protocols with teammates, view runs across the team
- **Built with Postgres, React, Flask** - optimized for responsiveness, fault-tolerance, and support for regulated environments. Backend based on Python means easy integration of scientific libraries.
